Cactpot is a minigame included in the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV.

The rules are simple. You start with one of the 9 board squares revealed, and you can reveal 3 more squares during play. After that, you must choose a slice (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) of the board. Once you have, all sqaures will reveal their values, and the sum of the slice you chose will determine your score.

The scores are not directly equivalent to the sum of the values of the slice, so it isn't just a matter of picking the slice with the highest value. This means there is more statistical probability that goes into maximizing your score.

The scores are:
6: 10000
7: 36
8: 720
9: 360
10: 80
11: 252
12: 108
13: 6868
14: 54
15: 180
16: 72
17: 180
18: 119
19: 36
20: 306
21: 1080
22: 144
23: 1800
24: 3600
